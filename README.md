# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to remove the grades of the 9th graders at Thomas High School. 
## Results
- The district summary was affected by not giving the full amount of students, causing a slight change in the average math score and the percentage of math, reading and overall scores but not too significant.
- Like in the district summary, the school summary was affected by getting different percentages of grades and average math scores, but this only affected Thomas High School.
- Thomas High School stayed in the second top school, even after the removal of the scores.
- Replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - The math and reading scores by grade were affected only by Thomas High School 9th grade scores. The percentage was replaced with NaN. 
  - The scores by school spending was not affected at all. 
  - The scores by school size was not affected at all.
  - The scores by school type was not affected at all.
## Summary
After reviews the updated DataFrames with the old ones, I saw at least 4 different changes. The first change was a slight change in the average math scores in the district and school summary. The second change was the percentages for math, reading and overall scores in the district and school summary. The third change was instead of a percentage in the math and reading score for ninth graders at Thomas High School, it was replaced with NaN. The last change I noticed was these changes overall was not very significant and hardly noticeable.
